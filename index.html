			<h1>Goal Statement</h1>
			<p>The mission of this trigonometry portfolio is to assimilate evidence of progress, accomplishment, and useful information for the future to provide a good study tool and reference for many trigonometry related things such as identities and common methods of attacking various problems. The portfolio will also be a resource assembled to be used as a review tool for the final at the end of the year.</p>

					<p>The most useful chart for me was the ASTC Chart as I like to call it. The chart is drawn inside a circle, and the circle has 4 quadrants. Within the first quadrant, all trigonometric functions are positive, moving to the second quadrant on the left, only sine and its reciprocal cosecant are positive; in the third quadrant beneath, tangent and and cotangent; in the fourth quadrant to the right, only cosine and secant. The chart also helped me memorize some common special right triangles.</p>

					<p>The best procedural process I learned was converting from radians to degrees and vice versa because we used it so many times on tests and quizzes. At first, I did not really understand the concept of radians and I could not understand and visualize what π/4 or 3π/7 was, so I decided to sit down and make a little step by step guide of how to convert between radians and degrees so I would learn some common radian fractions and so I could do well on the quizzes.</p>

				<blockquote class="pull-right entry-caption">
					<p>One of the common triangles that we started with was the right triangle. The right triangle can be solved using the Law of Sines (left) or the Law of Cosines. The Law of Sines solves requires a minimum of 3 pieces of information about the triangle, either 2 sides and one angle, or 2 angles and one side. Using these three pieces, the remaining sides and angles can be calculated. The Law of Sines helped on the assessments we had because it allowed me to solve the triangles using proportions.</p>

				<p>Of all the notes that we took in the trigonometry unit, the notes we copied for the identities were the most rushed beause we had to copy them down before the period ended. If I could improve these notes, I would by typing them up and printing out 2 copies, one to go in my math binder for math class, and one to go in my folder in my backpack, so I could study them every so often when I had time and so I would be prepared for the tests very easily.</p>

			<p>My best quiz was the initial quiz on trigonometric functions and their corresponding parent graphs. Not only did I do well on the quiz, it helped me remember the parent graph for the next assessments that we had on graphing trigonometric functions and it helped me draw each graph that much quicker and understand what each graph should look like so that when I looked at transformed graphs, I could easily think of the best function to draw that graph.</p>

			<p>Around halfway through the trigonometry unit we started verifying equations. Before I took the final test that had "Verify" problems, I decided to go back and revise some of the problems from homework to practice and to review with some problems. One of the problems I went back and solved used the pythagorean identity to replace the first part of the equation, and then the whole thing could be factored. Reviewing my homework and classwork problems helped me do well on the test.</p>

			<p>Throughout the unit, we used some of these things so often that many of their solutions and graphs became second nature to me, and so I created a crossword that is creative, not only because there are alphanumeric and symbol characters in the crossword, but also because it offers a fun way to review the unit before a test or quiz.</p>

			<p>The Do Now for the past few weeks was usually "Verify." and I thought that since we did a lot of problems involving verification, I should include that in my portfolio because it will probably be an important part of the final. Not only did all the do nows help me study for the test, they helped me understand different ways of solving problems, not only "Verify" problems, but any trigonometry problem.</p>

			<p>Verifying identities and solving them were some of the hardest things for me in this unit, and so I spent a lot of time practicing extra ones from the book and going over old homework problems, and an example of a solved identity is shown to the left. In this identity, cotangent and cosecant can be replaced with their full functions, and once that happens, the problem is a lot easier to solve. Just simplify the left side and both sides will end up with just cosine of x.</p>

In blue, is the graph <code>5sin(x)</code>, which increases the amplitude of the wave by 5 times the original 1. In the red graph, the function <code>sin(x) + 5</code> moves the whole graph up 5. In the green graph with the function <code>sin(4x)</code>, the graph's period is divided by 4, which makes each cycle appear smaller and more compact. Lastly, in the purple graph, the equation <code>sin(x - 2)</code> moves the whole graph to the right 2 units.</p>
